# GeneralizedSketchFamilies
Code for Generalized Sketch Families for Network Traffic Measurement (Sigmetrics 2020) including flow size/spread measurement using cSketch, bSketch and vSketch with plug-in unit estimators (counter, bitmap, FM sketch and HyperLogLog).

An example of data traces that are accepted is given in data and the measurement results are given in result.
